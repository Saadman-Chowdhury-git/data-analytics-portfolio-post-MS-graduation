# Data Analytics and Statistical Modeling Portfolio

This repository contains a structured collection of projects focused on statistical modeling, predictive insights, and data-driven decision making. 

Each project is organized in its own folder and highlights practical applications of statistics, machine learning, and causal inference in real-world contexts.
