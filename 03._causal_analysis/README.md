# Causal Analysis and Experimental Design

This project focuses on identifying causal drivers of hotel cancellations using observational data. The goal is to move beyond correlation and isolate the impact of booking channels on cancellation behavior.

The analysis applies logistic regression and statistical methods to control for confounding factors and evaluate robustness of results.

This work reflects practical applications of causal inference and decision-oriented analytics in real-world business settings.

Project documentation and code will be uploaded progressively as the work is refined and structured.
